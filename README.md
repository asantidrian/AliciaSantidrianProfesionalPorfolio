# ProfesionalPorfolio
Created a new repository called AliciaSantidrianProfesionalPortfolio

Page structured with header, body and footer.
In the body there is 2 big articles. One shows the projects and the second article contain 2 smaller sections. One about the work attitude and cualities of the developer. The second section show the programming languages the developer manage.

When page is loaded it shows a portfolio
with the developer's name,  and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

When one of the links is clicked in the navigation
the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

When  the link to the section about their work  is cliked, the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

The developer's first application's image is larger in size than the others

The page is resized or view the site on various screens and devices

The page has responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
